        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This Ballot site was created to facilitate fair, transparent, and anonymous allocation of limited resources, tasks, or prizes among a defined group of users. Our system guarantees that each registered user can select **one and only one** private ballot during an active session, ensuring a level playing field for everyone.</p>

    <section class="info-section integrity">
        <h3>Integrity and Fairness</h3>
        <p>Built by the Engineering team at iCISTEM, the core principle of this application is fairness. Once a user logs in and picks a ballot, that selection is immediately and atomically recorded in the database. This prevents any other user from selecting the same ballot, even in a high-traffic moment. The single-pick rule is enforced across devices and future logins using secure session management and persistent database checks.</p>
